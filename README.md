## Reflection

This was a fun project that was a part of the React course in The Odin Project, and I was able to put into practice what I learned in applying the useEffect hook to perform asynchronous operations inside a component, polish further my skills in React and making reusable components, and my first SPA in React by using react-router-dom.

This is basically just a simple Shopping Cart, and in order to improve performance, I utilized localStorage to store data once the effect finishes fetching data.

Learning and using Tailwind also made the project much more easier to make because of how easy it is to style components now.

The technologies implemented in this project are React, React Router and TailwindCSS. I used Vite, of course, to simplify development.
